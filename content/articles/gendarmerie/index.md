# The context üßëüèª‚Äçüíª



This winter, during the cybersecurity week at my university, I and my classmates had the pleasure and privilege to work with the National Gendarmerie (Bordeaux) to create two digital solutions to help gendarmerie professionals and civilian communities from the many everyday cybersecurity threats, risks and vulnerabilities that everyone is concerned about.



# What did we develope? ü§ì



Our goal for the 2 week project was (specifically in my team), an app to help gendarmes better detect digital objects used to perpetrate crimes (such as stalking other people, secure sensitive data, connected devices, etc), and help them with the process of perquisition (the process of collecting digital assets from a crime scene for future use in criminal records and court).



I personally took care of all the application integration using the **PandaSuite** software solution.



The other team was in charge of the development of a public website on good habits in internet use and digital environments. Here is the website ‚Üí https://safe-n-tech.netlify.app/



# What did I learn? üßê



In this project I learned many things, professionally and personally speaking.



First of all, the **communication** with the whole team and with the supervisors of the Gendarmerie was crucial to be able to validate all the data collection for future integration into the app.



In addition, we all met real professionals present at horrifyc crime scenes and got to know more about their struggles with technology and cybercrime these days that can affect real people's lives.



But the best thing I keep from this project is the hunger and passion with which all the professionals we met care about their work. They are the reason and inspiration why I shifted my focus from web development to cybersecurity education in order to protect people's lives and data, using digital skills.



## It was another amazing experience where I learned a lot and where I developed something that people in the National Gendarmerie are still using today.



(As you can imagine, I can't publish any photos of the application due to internal Gendarmerie policies, sorry for the inconvenience).
